# QuPath---Pixel-Classifier---Heart-H-E-Lipofuscin-Detection
This project contains the publicly available data and code used for the QuPath RandomTrees pixel classifier to identify lipofuscin in H&E-stained human heart tissue. 
This classifier was trained on H&E-stained images from frozen human heart tissues and should only be reasonably applied to similar tissues.
